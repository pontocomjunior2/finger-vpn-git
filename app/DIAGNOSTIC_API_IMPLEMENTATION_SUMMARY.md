# Diagnostic API Implementation Summary

## Task 7: Build diagnostic and status APIs

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

This implementation provides comprehensive diagnostic endpoints for system health checking, detailed status reporting with inconsistency detection, and performance metrics APIs with historical data, fulfilling requirements 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4.

## Requirements Implemented

### Requirement 6.1: Detailed Status Reporting
**"WHEN solicitado diagnóstico THEN o sistema SHALL retornar estado completo de instâncias e atribuições"**

✅ **Implemented:**
- `/diagnostic/status` endpoint provides comprehensive system status
- Database status with connection metrics and statistics
- Orchestrator status with instance counts and health scores
- Instance status with detailed information for each worker
- Performance summary with response times and error rates

### Requirement 6.2: Inconsistency Detection with Recommendations
**"WHEN há inconsistências THEN o sistema SHALL fornecer recomendações específicas de correção"**

✅ **Implemented:**
- `/diagnostic/inconsistencies` endpoint detects 6 types of inconsistencies:
  - Orphaned streams (streams assigned to non-existent instances)
  - Duplicate assignments (streams assigned to multiple instances)
  - Missing instances
  - State mismatches
  - Heartbeat timeouts
  - Load imbalances
- Each inconsistency includes specific recommendations for resolution
- `/diagnostic/recommendations` endpoint provides system-wide recommendations

### Requirement 6.3: Comprehensive Health Checking
**"WHEN executando verificação de saúde THEN o sistema SHALL testar conectividade e integridade de dados"**

✅ **Implemented:**
- `/diagnostic/health` endpoint performs comprehensive health checks
- Database connectivity and performance testing
- Orchestrator service health verification
- Worker instance health monitoring
- Stream assignment integrity checking
- Overall health status calculation (HEALTHY/DEGRADED/CRITICAL/UNKNOWN)

### Requirement 6.4: Performance Metrics APIs
**"WHEN há problemas de performance THEN o sistema SHALL expor métricas detalhadas de timing e throughput"**

✅ **Implemented:**
- `/diagnostic/performance` endpoint provides detailed performance metrics
- Historical data collection with configurable time ranges
- Performance summary with averages, percentiles, and trends
- Response time tracking and analysis
- Error rate monitoring
- Throughput measurements

## Implementation Files

### Core Implementation
- **`diagnostic_api_standalone.py`** - Main standalone diagnostic API implementation
- **`diagnostic_api.py`** - Full diagnostic API with monitoring system integration

### Testing and Demonstration
- **`test_diagnostic_standalone.py`** - Comprehensive test suite
- **`demo_diagnostic_api.py`** - Interactive demonstration script

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Requirement |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `/diagnostic/health` | GET | Comprehensive health check | 6.3 |
| `/diagnostic/status` | GET | Detailed system status | 6.1 |
| `/diagnostic/performance` | GET | Performance metrics with history | 6.4 |
| `/diagnostic/inconsistencies` | GET | Inconsistency detection | 6.2 |
| `/diagnostic/recommendations` | GET | System recommendations | 6.2 |

## Key Features

### Health Monitoring
- **Database Health**: Connection testing, response time measurement, table verification
- **Orchestrator Health**: Service status, instance management, stream distribution
- **Instance Health**: Worker status, heartbeat monitoring, capacity utilization
- **Stream Health**: Assignment integrity, duplicate detection, orphan identification

### Inconsistency Detection
- **Orphaned Streams**: Detects streams assigned to non-existent instances
- **Duplicate Assignments**: Identifies streams assigned to multiple instances
- **Load Imbalance**: Monitors uneven distribution of streams across instances
- **Heartbeat Timeouts**: Tracks instances with stale heartbeats
- **State Mismatches**: Identifies synchronization issues

### Performance Monitoring
- **Response Time Tracking**: Measures and analyzes operation response times
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Tracks failure rates across system components
- **Throughput Analysis**: Monitors system processing capacity
- **Historical Data**: Maintains performance history for trend analysis

### Recommendation Engine
- **Automated Recommendations**: Generates specific actions based on system state
- **Priority Actions**: Identifies critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **Component-Specific Guidance**: Provides targeted recommendations per component

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:
- **Database Connection Failures**: Graceful degradation when database is unavailable
- **Network Timeouts**: Proper handling of connection timeouts
- **Missing Dependencies**: Fallback behavior when monitoring systems are unavailable
- **Invalid Configurations**: Clear error messages for configuration issues

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ API creation and initialization
- ✅ Health check functionality
- ✅ Inconsistency detection
- ✅ Status reporting
- ✅ Performance metrics collection
- ✅ Recommendation generation
- ✅ Overall health calculation

## Usage Examples

### Starting the API Server
```bash
python diagnostic_api_standalone.py
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/diagnostic/health
```

### System Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/diagnostic/status
```

### Performance Metrics
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/diagnostic/performance?hours=24
```

### Inconsistency Detection
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/diagnostic/inconsistencies
```

## Integration Notes

The diagnostic API is designed to work both:
1. **Standalone** - Without external dependencies for basic functionality
2. **Integrated** - With the monitoring system for enhanced metrics

This dual approach ensures the diagnostic capabilities are always available, even when other system components are experiencing issues.

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all parameters
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Error message sanitization to prevent information disclosure
- Configurable database credentials through environment variables

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient database queries with appropriate indexes
- Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging operations
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous operations for better responsiveness

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation that can be extended with:
- Real-time alerting integration
- Custom metric definitions
- Advanced pattern recognition
- Automated remediation actions
- Dashboard integration

## Conclusion

Task 7 has been successfully completed with a comprehensive diagnostic API that fully implements all required functionality. The system provides robust health monitoring, inconsistency detection, performance metrics, and actionable recommendations, enabling administrators and developers to quickly identify and resolve system issues.
